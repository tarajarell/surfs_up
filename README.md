# surfs_up

# Overview
## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to look at the temperatures in Oahu across two months in the previous years: June and December. It is important to look at both summer and winter months when determining if the weather would be acceptable to open up a surf and ice cream shop. 
## What we are looking for
This analysis will provide information related to the differences in the temperature during the summer month of June and winter month of December. Recommendations regarding the potential success of a surf and ice cream shop, based on the data analysis, will also be provided.

# Results
## June Temperatures

- Average temperature is just under 75 degrees farenheight
- Maximum temperature reached was 85 degrees farenheight
- Minimum temperature reached was 64 degrees farenheight

## December Temperatures

- Average temperature is 71 degrees farenheight
- Maximum temperature reached was 83 degrees farenheight
- Minimum temperature reached was 56 degrees farenheight

# Summary
## Overall
There is a difference of 4 degrees farenheight for the average temperature in each month, with June being hotter on average than December. The max temp was also relatively similar, with June showing a high of 85 and December a high of 83 (a 2 point spread). However, the mimum temperatures showed a larger spread of 8 degrees between June (64 degrees farenheight) and December (56 degrees farenheight). 
## Recommendations
1. With climate change, it may behoove this analysis to add a date restriction filter to the query. Examining whether the data from the past few (no more than 5) years shows a greater divide in the summer vs winter for minimum temperature than what we currently found may more realistically illude to the likelihood (or not) of obtaining wintertime ice cream customers. 
2. It may benefit this analysis to obtain and query data related to the ocean water temperatures as well as the weather temperatures. In doing so, the decisions surrounding what to provide during each season may change. For example, wet suite may become an item worth purchasing for the shop should temperatures in the winter reliable dip below a certain threshold.
